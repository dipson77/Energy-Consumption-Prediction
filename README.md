# Energy Consumption Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict energy consumption using machine learning techniques. It utilizes historical energy consumption data to build predictive models and analyze patterns in energy usage.

## Dataset

-File : `Energy_consumption.csv`
-Description: Contains historical energy consumption data with various features.
-Purpose: Used to train and evaluate predictive mdoels.

## Project Structure

- `Energy_Consumption_Prediction.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training.
- `Energy_consumption.csv` - Dataset used for predictions.
- `README.md` - Documentation for the project.
